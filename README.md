# The Bonparte Cafe Website

A modern café website with an admin panel to manage menu, specials, and events. Everything updates live when you make changes.

## What You Need

- **Node.js** (version 14 or newer)
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

## How to Run It

### Step 1: Get the files
Download or extract all the project files into one folder called `bonparte-cafe`.

### Step 2: Open terminal
Open your computer's terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

### Step 3: Install the backend
Go into the backend folder and install what's needed:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start the server
Run this command:
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 5: Open your browser
Once the server is running, open these two links:

- **Main website:** http://localhost:3000
- **Admin panel:** http://localhost:3000/admin.html

### Step 6: Start managing
Use the admin panel to:
- Add/edit/delete menu items
- Update daily specials
- Manage events
- Change contact info

Changes save automatically and appear on the main website immediately.
